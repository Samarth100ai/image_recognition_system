# Image Recognition System

## Setup
1. Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS / Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   # Additional suggestions / improvements

2. Install requirements:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3.Prepare dataset for training
Create a folder named dataset with this structure:

dataset/
  train/
    class_a/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
    class_b/
      img1.jpg
  val/
    class_a/
    class_b/

4.Train model
  python train.py
  This will save models/model.h5 and classes.json.

5.Run the web app
    python app.py
    Open http://localhost:5000.

Notes

If you don't want to train, you can use a pre-trained model or convert a model from TensorFlow Hub.

For production, consider using gunicorn and a reverse proxy like Nginx, plus GPU-backed training.


    

- Add async uploads & feedback (AJAX) for a smoother UX.
- Use Dockerfile and docker-compose for reproducible deployments.
- Add unit tests for `model_utils` functions.
- Store uploads in cloud storage (S3) when deploying to scale.
- Protect endpoints if the app is public.

*If you'd like, I can:*
- generate a `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` next,
- create a small example dataset and sample training run script,
- or produce a zipped project you can download.
